description:
    "Fruit is a dependency injection framework for C++, loosely inspired by the "
    "Guice framework for Java. It uses C++ metaprogramming together with some "
    "new C++11 features to detect most injection problems at compile-time. It "
    "allows to split the implementation code in \"components\" (aka modules) that "
    "can be assembled to form other components. From a component with no "
    "requirements it's then possible to create an injector, that provides an "
    "instance of the interfaces exposed by the component."
